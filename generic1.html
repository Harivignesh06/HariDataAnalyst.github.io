								<h2><b>Project Summary</b></h2><br>
								<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
								<p><b>In this Project I have two Datasets, one containing all the app details available in the Play Store, and the other containing user reviews and their sentiment.<br>
The objective of this project is to provide various insights for businesses to develop an app through a complete analysis of Play Store apps.
<h3><b>Objectives</b></h3>
I have Analyzed in various aspects such as,<br>
(i) Which type of app is mostly preferred by a user like Free or Paid ?<br>
(ii) In which Category a app should be developed<br>
(iii) Review counts over the time ,Top 10 Reviews according to the sentiment<br>
(iv) Correlation of the data<br>
Additionally, I have analyzed even more factors which will be useful for the development of businesses.<br>
<h3><b>Observations</b></h3>
According to my Analysis, I have determined that if the development process is properly structured and the app is designed to meet user expectations, it will be highly welcomed by users.<br>
Otherwise, the development team should remain focused after the release of an app and should actively seek feedback and use it to further develop the app.<br>
So, when come to the point of improvement in a app,we should focus on three sections such as number of Installs,sentiment of the Reviews,range of Ratings These three plays a major role in which a app will be determined by the user.<br>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
Focus your attention on the development process and strive to achieve the desired outcome. Doing so will ensure that you are successful in your endeavors.<br>
See the analysis, gain insights and develop accordingly. Utilize the analysis to gain a better understanding of the situation and make informed decisions that will lead to successful outcomes.By leveraging data-driven insights, you can create an app that meets the needs of your customers and helps your business reach its goals. With the right app, you can unlock new opportunities for growth and success.<br>
